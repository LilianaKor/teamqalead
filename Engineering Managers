Enhancing Employee Learning and Performance: A Guide for Engineering Managers
EM Focus on Individual Performance
If employees perceive that their manager values only individual performance in delivering tasks, they will be less motivated to help others or share knowledge. As an Engineering Manager (EM), if you use individual performance metrics, consider Goodhart’s Law and explore Deming’s or Ackoff’s books on systems thinking. Transition away from these metrics to foster a more collaborative environment.

EM Focus on Employee’s Time Utilization
Physiology of Learning

Neuroscientific research reveals that stress and anxiety negatively impact learning, while positive motivation and engagement improve brain function related to memory and executive function. Learning requires a stress-free environment and dedicated time. Allocating two hours out of an eight-hour workday for learning may reduce productivity in the remaining hours. Instead, consider dedicating a full day each week for learning, free from workload or deadlines.

Psychology of Learning

Learning demands vulnerability. A trustworthy and respectful environment is essential for effective learning. Here's how to foster this:

Vulnerability: Learning involves moving from 'not knowing' to 'knowing.' This process is psychologically challenging, especially for senior team members. Ensure that everyone on the team, including yourself, engages in learning and demonstrates vulnerability. Lead by example: admit when you don’t know something, ask specialists for help, make the learning process transparent, and show how rewarding it is. Publicly make and learn from mistakes.

Safe Environment: Avoid judging learning progress. Learning is an exploratory process, and each person progresses at their own pace. Resist the urge to make people learn faster or compete. Avoid implementing a school-like grading system, which promotes competition and is increasingly criticized by modern educators. Don’t use tests or examinations to assess learning progress—learning is continuous and shouldn't be bound by arbitrary dates.

Flexibility

Instead of setting rigid 'growth plans' for each person, focus on creating a culture of mutual learning and support. Your goal is not to make everyone equal in knowledge but to achieve knowledge overlap to minimize information loss. Foster a community where individuals are encouraged to learn and teach each other. Embrace diversity in learning styles and support each person’s unique journey.

Glory

Provide opportunities for employees to showcase their newly acquired skills. Encourage voluntary Friday talks or similar events where team members can present what they've learned. Support and assist them in preparing these presentations, but avoid pushing them.

Summary
Allocate proper free time for learning, such as a half-day each week (e.g., Friday afternoon).
Lead by example: engage in learning with your team and do it publicly.
Create a supportive and non-judgmental environment: avoid grading and tracking progress.
Provide opportunities for employees to share what they've learned.
By implementing these strategies, you can create an environment that encourages continuous learning, collaboration, and mutual respect.
